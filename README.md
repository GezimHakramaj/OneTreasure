# OneTreasure
## Intro to Game Programming CISC 3660 project

This is a small project us three have developed together using Unity, C#.
The game is a simple game, you are a pirate with a small crew. Defeat enemy bandits and enemy pirates while trying to reach the best treasure in the land!

### Controls
```
Select a player character and then an enemy character!
Select to shoot or melee attack them
When your team's character's health all reach zero you lose! And vice versa for the enemy team!


Can you get the treasure? Goodluck!
